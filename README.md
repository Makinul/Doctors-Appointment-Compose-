# Doctor Appointment App

This Android application allows patients to easily find and book appointments with doctors. It is built using the **latest Android architecture** principles and the modern **Jetpack Compose** UI framework for a reactive and declarative user interface.

## Features

1.  **View Doctor List:**
    * Browse a comprehensive list of available doctors, built with composable UI elements.
    * View doctor profiles, including their specialization, availability, and potentially ratings, rendered using Jetpack Compose.
    * Search and filter doctors based on specialty, location, or name, with UI components built using Compose.

2.  **Book Appointment:**
    * Select a doctor from the Compose-rendered list.
    * View the doctor's available appointment slots (dates and times), displayed using Jetpack Compose layouts.
    * Choose a preferred date and time for the appointment through interactive Compose components.
    * Confirm the booking with necessary patient details using Jetpack Compose input fields.
    * Receive confirmation of the appointment displayed with Compose UI.

3.  **View Upcoming Appointments:**
    * Access a list of all scheduled future appointments, presented using Jetpack Compose lists.
    * View details of each appointment, including doctor's name, date, and time, all within composable UI elements.
    * Potentially options to reschedule or cancel appointments (depending on future implementation, likely using Compose UI for interactions).

## Technologies Used

* Android SDK
* Kotlin (leveraging Kotlin's features for Compose development)
* **Jetpack Compose:** Android's modern toolkit for building native UI with a declarative approach.
* **Latest Android Architecture Components:**
    * **ViewModel:** For managing UI-related data in a lifecycle-aware manner.
    * **Compose Navigation:** For handling in-app navigation between composable screens.
    * **StateFlow or LiveData:** For observing data changes and updating the UI reactively within Compose.
    * **Hilt:** For dependency injection, making the codebase more testable and maintainable.
    * **Retrofit or Ktor:** For type-safe network requests, seamlessly integrated with Kotlin coroutines.
    * **Coil or Accompanist Image Loading:** For efficient image loading within Jetpack Compose.
    * **Room Persistence Library (optional):** For local data storage, interacting well with Kotlin coroutines and Flow.
    * **Material Design 3 Components:** Implemented using Jetpack Compose's Material 3 support for a modern look and feel.

## Setup Instructions

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    * Android Studio (latest version recommended for optimal Jetpack Compose support) installed on your development machine.
    * Basic understanding of Android development and Jetpack Compose concepts.

2.  **Clone the Repository (if applicable):**
    ```bash
    git clone [repository_url]
    ```

3.  **Open in Android Studio:**
    * Open Android Studio and select "Open an existing Android Studio project".
    * Navigate to the cloned repository or the project directory and click "Open".

4.  **Build and Run:**
    * Ensure you have a virtual device (emulator) or a physical Android device connected.
    * Click the "Run" button (green triangle) in Android Studio to build and run the application, leveraging the power of Jetpack Compose for UI rendering.

## API Integration (Conceptual)

This application would typically communicate with a backend API to fetch doctor data, availability, and manage bookings. The API interactions would likely be handled using Kotlin coroutines and a library like Retrofit or Ktor, with data being consumed and displayed in the Jetpack Compose UI. The API endpoints might include:

* `/doctors`: To retrieve a list of doctors (with optional query parameters for filtering).
* `/doctors/{doctor_id}`: To retrieve details of a specific doctor.
* `/doctors/{doctor_id}/availability`: To fetch available appointment slots for a doctor.
* `/appointments`: To create a new appointment booking (POST request).
* `/appointments/upcoming`: To retrieve the logged-in user's upcoming appointments.

## Future Enhancements

* User authentication and registration (implemented with Jetpack Compose UI).
* Doctor profiles with more detailed information (displayed using composable layouts).
* Rescheduling and cancellation of appointments (interactive UI built with Compose).
* Push notifications for appointment reminders (potentially integrated with Compose UI for display).
* Integration with maps for location services (displaying information within Compose).
* Payment gateway integration for online consultations or appointment fees (UI built with Jetpack Compose).
* Support for different appointment types (user selection through Compose UI).
