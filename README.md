## API Integration (Conceptual)

This application would typically communicate with a backend API to fetch doctor data, availability, and manage bookings. The API endpoints might include:

* `/doctors`: To retrieve a list of doctors (with optional query parameters for filtering).
* `/doctors/{doctor_id}`: To retrieve details of a specific doctor.
* `/doctors/{doctor_id}/availability`: To fetch available appointment slots for a doctor.
* `/appointments`: To create a new appointment booking (POST request).
* `/appointments/upcoming`: To retrieve the logged-in user's upcoming appointments.

## Future Enhancements

* User authentication and registration.
* Doctor profiles with more detailed information (e.g., experience, qualifications, reviews).
* Rescheduling and cancellation of appointments.
* Push notifications for appointment reminders.
* Integration with maps for location services.
* Payment gateway integration for online consultations or appointment fees.
* Support for different appointment types (e.g., in-person, video call).
